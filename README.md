Today:
A simple GraphQL API written in Go. You can view a sample employee's information in a demand-driven manner and add to the list of groups/activities that they're a part of via a GraphQL mutation.
   
Longterm Vision:
A portal for companies with multiple campuses to bridge the gap and foster communication between different offices. This GraphQL Go API's purpose is to allow employees visiting different office campuses to connect with the employees there via shared groups/activities. Once fleshed out, this API will provide suggestions for activities to do and people to meet based on what campus the employee marks themselves as at and whether or not it is their home campus. This ideally encourages collaberation at home compuses as well as improving communication between different office locations.
